## Use of .gitignore
gitignore is used to know which files to ignore when you commit your project to your Github repository. This will help you to keep your repositories clean and not bloated and is also good for sensitive information as it ignores the information.

## Storage of Credentials and Sessitive Information
Because this project is public everyone will be able to see all the info that is within the project thus it is not recommended to store any credentials or info that you wish to keep private in this project.
